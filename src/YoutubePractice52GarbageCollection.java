    Every computer has finite memory
    All apps use memory

    When we create a new object, for example, it goes into system resources and
    grabs a portion of memory (enough to hold an object of this size/stature), then
    creates and allocates to appropriate place

    //in theory, you could run out of memory and then get runtime error; no more memory to be allocated

    //there's a de-constructor which gives memory back to the system
    //up to programmer to give memory back to system when possible
    //give memory back/release it when you longer need it
    In Java, this process is transparent: called garbage collection

    If you start running low on memory, Java will release memory not being utilized
    This happens in background
