Hello, world!

This is a brief description regarding the content within this repo. This repo hosts
almost all of my Java-related exercises during my time at Codeup (full stack web development).
The Codeup Java section of the curriculum was split into Java 1, Java 2, and Java 3. For a
quick visual glance, the directories within the source directory are as below:

Within the source directory, the Codeup Java exercises (excluding Spring content) are as below:

The rest of the exercises are my own practice from a YouTube series by Math and Science channel on Java.
I completed all volumes (1 - 4); below is a glimpse of the YouTube-related classes:
